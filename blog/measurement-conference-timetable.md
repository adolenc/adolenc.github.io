- measurement confrence just ended
- great fun
- tasked with making a timetable
- slightly different way of defining a
- over 500 attendees

- constraints
  - 500 registered attendees, 70 registered lectures
  - 3 days, each day 5 time slots, each slot has 8 lecture rooms
  - ~30 of the registered lectures are by Dewesoft employees, the rest are from other registered attendees
  - each attendee can choose up to 15 lectures they want to listen to

- used to be generated by hand a decade ago
- now we use approximation algorithms to generate them

- 2 stages
  - stage 1: generate a valid 
  - stage 2: assign the attendees to individual lectures in such a way that most of them 

stage 1:
- there are actually a few more constraints:
  - registered attendees that have their own lectures should only hold exactly one lecture, so they can attend other lectures
  - Dewesoft employees can hold multiple lectures
  - some lectures can only be held in certain slots or certain (subset of) rooms
  - some lectures should be held before others (think basic -> advanced type of lectures)
- MOVE: swap two lectures. after swapping, rearrange the lectures so that the lectures with most registered attendees get the biggest rooms
- ENERGY: check that lecturer doesn't have a lecture in the same slot. all the constraints have to hold. lectures should be held in rooms so that they have enough chairs for all the registered attendees for that lecture. all of these constraints should hold so energy should end up as 0, otherwise we should manually relax some constraints.

stage 2:
- start by randomly assigning guests to every lecture they registered for (if any lecture is repeated, choose a any random one)
- MOVE: move a random attendee between any of his "repeated" lectures
- ENERGY: for each slot, check how many times an attendee appears two or more times. the actual energy is actually the # of appearances - 1 squared and should be minimized (explain the 1/3 ~= 5/15 >> 1/15 in terms of how bad it is)

results:
- more than 90% of wishes were respected
- in the end, guests anyway use the timetable as a reference, so many pick other lectures to go to

ideas for alternative approaches:
