- i used to use arch, it was shit
- i used debian testing 10 years, accidentally switched to unstable once and couldnt really go back
- package managers are great but afraid to update my system to not break anything

- nix seems like a lot of effort to figure out
- fedora immutable wouldnt install in virtualbox
- even if it did, even something as simple as changing a keyboard layout seems like an insane amount of work

- debian stable
  - tmpfs with half of ram
  - no swap
  - oom killer
- base linux
  - X.org
  - i3
  - nvidia drivers
  - pulseaudio
  - nmtui
  - yadm for dotfiles
  - kitty terminal
    - zsh
    - fzf
  - ssh
  - colemak keyboard layout (where is it defined)
- distrobox with ubuntu installed 
  - install command (with nvidia cuda)
  - binding in i3 for new terminal
  - "n" alias for new terminal in current directory
  - passthrough to host os
  - how to destroy a container
  - how does docker work
- flatpak for gui apps that should be updated all the time
  - flatpak ~/bin/ scripts
  - flatpak permissions app
  - updating flatpaks
  - steam & proton
  - download folders default to tmpfs

- solid setup, debian stable is pretty much unbreakable, and the containers themselves are disposable, so i can't apt-get mess my setup up
